<h1>AN UNPROTECTED FEMALE AT THE PYRAMIDS</h1>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the happy days when we were
young, no description conveyed to us so complete an idea of
mysterious reality as that of an Oriental city.&nbsp; We knew it
was actually there, but had such vague notions of its ways and
looks!&nbsp; Let any one remember his early impressions as to
Bagdad or Grand Cairo, and then say if this was not so.&nbsp; It
was probably taken from the &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; and the
picture produced was one of strange, fantastic, luxurious houses;
of women who were either very young and very beautiful, or else
very old and very cunning; but in either state exercising much
more influence in life than women in the East do now; of
good-natured, capricious, though sometimes tyrannical monarchs;
and of life full of quaint mysteries, quite unintelligible in
every phasis, and on that account the more picturesque.</p>
<p>And perhaps Grand Cairo has thus filled us with more wonder
even than Bagdad.&nbsp; We have been in a certain manner at home
at Bagdad, but have only visited Grand Cairo occasionally.&nbsp;
I know no place which was to me, in early years, so delightfully
mysterious as Grand Cairo.</p>
<p>But the route to India and Australia has changed all
this.&nbsp; Men from all countries going to the East, now pass
through Cairo, and its streets and costumes are no longer strange
to us.&nbsp; It has become also a resort for invalids, or rather
for those who fear that they may become invalids if they remain
in a cold climate during the winter months.&nbsp; And thus at
Cairo there is always to be found a considerable population of
French, Americans, and of English.&nbsp; Oriental life is brought
home to us, dreadfully diluted by western customs, and the
delights of the &ldquo;Arabian Nights&rdquo; are shorn of half
their value.&nbsp; When we have seen a thing it is never so
magnificent to us as when it was half unknown.</p>
<p>It is not much that we deign to learn from these
Orientals,&mdash;we who glory in our civilisation.&nbsp; We do
not copy their silence or their abstemiousness, nor that
invariable mindfulness of his own personal dignity which always
adheres to a Turk or to an Arab.&nbsp; We chatter as much at
Cairo as elsewhere, and eat as much and drink as much, and dress
ourselves generally in the same old ugly costume.&nbsp; But we do
usually take upon ourselves to wear red caps, and we do ride on
donkeys.</p>
<p>Nor are the visitors from the West to Cairo by any means
confined to the male sex.&nbsp; Ladies are to be seen in the
streets quite regardless of the Mahommedan custom which presumes
a veil to be necessary for an appearance in public; and, to tell
the truth, the Mahommedans in general do not appear to be much
shocked by their effrontery.</p>
<p>A quarter of the town has in this way become inhabited by men
wearing coats and waistcoats, and by women who are without veils;
but the English tongue in Egypt finds its centre at
Shepheard&rsquo;s Hotel.&nbsp; It is here that people congregate
who are looking out for parties to visit with them the Upper
Nile, and who are generally all smiles and courtesy; and here
also are to be found they who have just returned from this
journey, and who are often in a frame of mind towards their
companions that is much less amiable.&nbsp; From hence, during
the winter, a cort&eacute;ge proceeds almost daily to the
pyramids, or to Memphis, or to the petrified forest, or to the
City of the Sun.&nbsp; And then, again, four or five times a
month the house is filled with young aspirants going out to
India, male and female, full of valour and bloom; or with others
coming home, no longer young, no longer aspiring, but laden with
children and grievances.</p>
<p>The party with whom we are at present concerned is not about
to proceed further than the Pyramids, and we shall be able to go
with them and return in one and the same day.</p>
<p>It consisted chiefly of an English family, Mr. and Mrs. Damer,
their daughter, and two young sons;&mdash;of these chiefly,
because they were the nucleus to which the others had attached
themselves as adherents; they had originated the journey, and in
the whole management of it Mr. Damer regarded himself as the
master.</p>
<p>The adherents were, firstly, M. Delabordeau, a Frenchman, now
resident in Cairo, who had given out that he was in some way
concerned in the canal about to be made between the Mediterranean
and the Red Sea.&nbsp; In discussion on this subject he had
become acquainted with Mr. Damer; and although the latter
gentleman, true to English interests, perpetually declared that
the canal would never be made, and thus irritated M. Delabordeau
not a little&mdash;nevertheless, some measure of friendship had
grown up between them.</p>
<p>There was also an American gentleman, Mr. Jefferson Ingram,
who was comprising all countries and all nations in one grand
tour, as American gentlemen so often do.&nbsp; He was young and
good-looking, and had made himself especially agreeable to Mr.
Damer, who had declared, more than once, that Mr. Ingram was by
far the most rational American he had ever met.&nbsp; Mr. Ingram
would listen to Mr. Damer by the half-hour as to the virtue of
the British Constitution, and had even sat by almost with
patience when Mr. Damer had expressed a doubt as to the good
working of the United States&rsquo; scheme of
policy,&mdash;which, in an American, was most wonderful.&nbsp;
But some of the sojourners at Shepheard&rsquo;s had observed that
Mr. Ingram was in the habit of talking with Miss Damer almost as
much as with her father, and argued from that, that fond as the
young man was of politics, he did sometimes turn his mind to
other things also.</p>
<p>And then there was Miss Dawkins.&nbsp; Now Miss Dawkins was an
important person, both as to herself and as to her line of life,
and she must be described.&nbsp; She was, in the first place, an
unprotected female of about thirty years of age.&nbsp; As this is
becoming an established profession, setting itself up as it were
in opposition to the old world idea that women, like green peas,
cannot come to perfection without supporting-sticks, it will be
understood at once what were Miss Dawkins&rsquo;s
sentiments.&nbsp; She considered&mdash;or at any rate so
expressed herself&mdash;that peas could grow very well without
sticks, and could not only grow thus unsupported, but could also
make their way about the world without any incumbrance of sticks
whatsoever.&nbsp; She did not intend, she said, to rival Ida
Pfeiffer, seeing that she was attached in a moderate way to bed
and board, and was attached to society in a manner almost more
than moderate; but she had no idea of being prevented from seeing
anything she wished to see because she had neither father, nor
husband, nor brother available for the purpose of escort.&nbsp;
She was a human creature, with arms and legs, she said; and she
intended to use them.&nbsp; And this was all very well; but
nevertheless she had a strong inclination to use the arms and
legs of other people when she could make them serviceable.</p>
<p>In person Miss Dawkins was not without attraction.&nbsp; I
should exaggerate if I were to say that she was beautiful and
elegant; but she was good looking, and not usually ill
mannered.&nbsp; She was tall, and gifted with features rather
sharp and with eyes very bright.&nbsp; Her hair was of the
darkest shade of brown, and was always worn in bandeaux, very
neatly.&nbsp; She appeared generally in black, though other
circumstances did not lead one to suppose that she was in
mourning; and then, no other travelling costume is so
convenient!&nbsp; She always wore a dark broad-brimmed straw hat,
as to the ribbons on which she was rather particular.&nbsp; She
was very neat about her gloves and boots; and though it cannot be
said that her dress was got up without reference to expense,
there can be no doubt that it was not effected without
considerable outlay,&mdash;and more considerable thought.</p>
<p>Miss Dawkins&mdash;Sabrina Dawkins was her name, but she
seldom had friends about her intimate enough to use the word
Sabrina&mdash;was certainly a clever young woman.&nbsp; She could
talk on most subjects, if not well, at least well enough to
amuse.&nbsp; If she had not read much, she never showed any
lamentable deficiency; she was good-humoured, as a rule, and
could on occasions be very soft and winning.&nbsp; People who had
known her long would sometimes say that she was selfish; but with
new acquaintance she was forbearing and self-denying.</p>
<p>With what income Miss Dawkins was blessed no one seemed to
know.&nbsp; She lived like a gentlewoman, as far as outward
appearance went, and never seemed to be in want; but some people
would say that she knew very well how many sides there were to a
shilling, and some enemy had once declared that she was an
&ldquo;old soldier.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was Miss Dawkins.</p>
<p>She also, as well as Mr. Ingram and M. Delabordeau, had laid
herself out to find the weak side of Mr. Damer.&nbsp; Mr. Damer,
with all his family, was going up the Nile, and it was known that
he had room for two in his boat over and above his own
family.&nbsp; Miss Dawkins had told him that she had not quite
made up her mind to undergo so great a fatigue, but that,
nevertheless, she had a longing of the soul to see something of
Nubia.&nbsp; To this Mr. Damer had answered nothing but
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; which Miss Dawkins had not found to be
encouraging.</p>
<p>But she had not on that account despaired.&nbsp; To a married
man there are always two sides, and in this instance there was
Mrs. Damer as well as Mr. Damer.&nbsp; When Mr. Damer said
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Miss Dawkins sighed, and said, &ldquo;Yes,
indeed!&rdquo; then smiled, and betook herself to Mrs. Damer.</p>
<p>Now Mrs. Damer was soft-hearted, and also somewhat
old-fashioned.&nbsp; She did not conceive any violent affection
for Miss Dawkins, but she told her daughter that &ldquo;the
single lady by herself was a very nice young woman, and that it
was a thousand pities she should have to go about so much alone
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Damer had turned up her pretty nose, thinking, perhaps,
how small was the chance that it ever should be her own lot to be
an unprotected female.&nbsp; But Miss Dawkins carried her point
at any rate as regarded the expedition to the Pyramids.</p>
<p>Miss Damer, I have said, had a pretty nose.&nbsp; I may also
say that she had pretty eyes, mouth, and chin, with other
necessary appendages, all pretty.&nbsp; As to the two Master
Damers, who were respectively of the ages of fifteen and sixteen,
it may be sufficient to say that they were conspicuous for red
caps and for the constancy with which they raced their
donkeys.</p>
<p>And now the donkeys, and the donkey boys, and the dragomans
were all standing at the steps of Shepheard&rsquo;s Hotel.&nbsp;
To each donkey there was a donkey-boy, and to each gentleman
there was a dragoman, so that a goodly cort&eacute;ge was
assembled, and a goodly noise was made.&nbsp; It may here be
remarked, perhaps with some little pride, that not half the noise
is given in Egypt to persons speaking any other language that is
bestowed on those whose vocabulary is English.</p>
<p>This lasted for half an hour.&nbsp; Had the party been French
the donkeys would have arrived only fifteen minutes before the
appointed time.&nbsp; And then out came Damer p&egrave;re and
Damer m&egrave;re, Damer fille, and Damer fils.&nbsp; Damer
m&egrave;re was leaning on her husband, as was her wont.&nbsp;
She was not an unprotected female, and had no desire to make any
attempts in that line.&nbsp; Damer fille was attended sedulously
by Mr. Ingram, for whose demolishment, however, Mr. Damer still
brought up, in a loud voice, the fag ends of certain political
arguments which he would fain have poured direct into the ears of
his opponent, had not his wife been so persistent in claiming her
privileges.&nbsp; M. Delabordeau should have followed with Miss
Dawkins, but his French politeness, or else his fear of the
unprotected female, taught him to walk on the other side of the
mistress of the party.</p>
<p>Miss Dawkins left the house with an eager young Damer yelling
on each side of her; but nevertheless, though thus neglected by
the gentlemen of the party, she was all smiles and prettiness,
and looked so sweetly on Mr. Ingram when that gentleman stayed a
moment to help her on to her donkey, that his heart almost
misgave him for leaving her as soon as she was in her seat.</p>
<p>And then they were off.&nbsp; In going from the hotel to the
Pyramids our party had not to pass through any of the queer old
narrow streets of the true Cairo&mdash;Cairo the Oriental.&nbsp;
They all lay behind them as they went down by the back of the
hotel, by the barracks of the Pasha and the College of the
Dervishes, to the village of old Cairo and the banks of the
Nile.</p>
<p>Here they were kept half an hour while their dragomans made a
bargain with the ferryman, a stately reis, or captain of a boat,
who declared with much dignity that he could not carry them over
for a sum less than six times the amount to which he was justly
entitled; while the dragomans, with great energy on behalf of
their masters, offered him only five times that sum.</p>
<p>As far as the reis was concerned, the contest might soon have
been at an end, for the man was not without a conscience; and
would have been content with five times and a half; but then the
three dragomans quarrelled among themselves as to which should
have the paying of the money, and the affair became very
tedious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What horrid, odious men!&rdquo; said Miss Dawkins,
appealing to Mr. Damer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think they will let
us go over at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose they will; people do get over
generally, I believe.&nbsp; Abdallah!&nbsp; Abdallah! why
don&rsquo;t you pay the man?&nbsp; That fellow is always striving
to save half a piastre for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he wasn&rsquo;t quite so particular,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Damer, who was already becoming rather tired; &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s a very honest man in trying to protect
us from being robbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he is,&rdquo; said Miss Dawkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
a delightful trait of national character it is to see these men
so faithful to their employers.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then at last
they got over the ferry, Mr. Ingram having descended among the
combatants, and settled the matter in dispute by threats and
shouts, and an uplifted stick.</p>
<p>They crossed the broad Nile exactly at the spot where the
nilometer, or river guage, measures from day to day, and from
year to year, the increasing or decreasing treasures of the
stream, and landed at a village where thousands of eggs are made
into chickens by the process of artificial incubation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Damer thought that it was very hard upon the maternal
hens&mdash;the hens which should have been maternal&mdash;that
they should be thus robbed of the delights of motherhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So unnatural, you know,&rdquo; said Miss Dawkins;
&ldquo;so opposed to the fostering principles of creation.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you think so, Mr. Ingram?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ingram said he didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; He was again
seating Miss Damer on her donkey, and it must be presumed that he
performed this feat clumsily; for Fanny Damer could jump on and
off the animal with hardly a finger to help her, when her brother
or her father was her escort; but now, under the hands of Mr.
Ingram, this work of mounting was one which required considerable
time and care.&nbsp; All which Miss Dawkins observed with
precision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well talking,&rdquo; said Mr.
Damer, bringing up his donkey nearly alongside that of Mr.
Ingram, and ignoring his daughter&rsquo;s presence, just as he
would have done that of his dog; &ldquo;but you must admit that
political power is more equally distributed in England than it is
in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is,&rdquo; said Mr. Ingram; &ldquo;equally
distributed among, we will say, three dozen families,&rdquo; and
he made a feint as though to hold in his impetuous donkey, using
the spur, however, at the same time on the side that was unseen
by Mr. Damer.&nbsp; As he did so, Fanny&rsquo;s donkey became
equally impetuous, and the two cantered on in advance of the
whole party.&nbsp; It was quite in vain that Mr. Damer, at the
top of his voice, shouted out something about &ldquo;three dozen
corruptible demagogues.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Ingram found it quite
impossible to restrain his donkey so as to listen to the
sarcasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe papa would talk politics,&rdquo; said
Fanny, &ldquo;if he were at the top of Mont Blanc, or under the
Falls of Niagara.&nbsp; I do hate politics, Mr.
Ingram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for that, very,&rdquo; said Mr. Ingram,
almost sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, why?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t want me to talk
politics, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In America we are all politicians, more or less; and,
therefore, I suppose you will hate us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I rather think I should,&rdquo; said Fanny;
&ldquo;you would be such bores.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there was
something in her eye, as she spoke, which atoned for the
harshness of her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very nice young man is Mr. Ingram; don&rsquo;t you
think so?&rdquo; said Miss Dawkins to Mrs. Damer.&nbsp; Mrs.
Damer was going along upon her donkey, not altogether
comfortably.&nbsp; She much wished to have her lord and
legitimate protector by her side, but he had left her to the care
of a dragoman whose English was not intelligible to her, and she
was rather cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Miss Dawkins, I don&rsquo;t know who are nice
and who are not.&nbsp; This nasty donkey stumbles at ever
step.&nbsp; There!&nbsp; I know I shall be down
directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not be at all afraid of that; they are
perfectly safe, I believe, always,&rdquo; said Miss Dawkins,
rising in her stirrup, and handling her reins quite
triumphantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;A very little practice will make you
quite at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by a very little
practice.&nbsp; I have been here six weeks.&nbsp; Why did you put
me on such a bad donkey as this?&rdquo; and she turned to
Abdallah, the dragoman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him berry good donkey, my lady; berry good,&mdash;best
of all.&nbsp; Call him Jack in Cairo.&nbsp; Him go to Pyramid and
back, and mind noting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he say, Miss Dawkins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says that that donkey is one called Jack.&nbsp; If
so I&rsquo;ve had him myself many times, and Jack is a very good
donkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you had him now with all my heart,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Damer.&nbsp; Upon which Miss Dawkins offered to change; but
those perils of mounting and dismounting were to Mrs. Damer a
great deal too severe to admit of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven miles of canal to be carried out into the sea, at
a minimum depth of twenty-three feet, and the stone to be fetched
from Heaven knows where!&nbsp; All the money in France
wouldn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was addressed by Mr.
Damer to M. Delabordeau, whom he had caught after the abrupt
flight of Mr. Ingram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Den we will borrow a leetle from England,&rdquo; said
M. Delabordeau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precious little, I can tell you.&nbsp; Such stock would
not hold its price in our markets for twenty-four hours.&nbsp; If
it were made, the freights would be too heavy to allow of
merchandise passing through.&nbsp; The heavy goods would all go
round; and as for passengers and mails, you don&rsquo;t expect to
get them, I suppose, while there is a railroad ready made to
their hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye vill carry all your ships through vidout any
transportation.&nbsp; Think of that, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&nbsp; You are worse than Ingram.&nbsp; Of all
the plans I ever heard of it is the most monstrous, the most
impracticable, the most&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; But here he was
interrupted by the entreaties of his wife, who had, in absolute
deed and fact, slipped from her donkey, and was now calling
lustily for her husband&rsquo;s aid.&nbsp; Whereupon Miss Dawkins
allied herself to the Frenchman, and listened with an air of
strong conviction to those arguments which were so weak in the
ears of Mr. Damer.&nbsp; M. Delabordeau was about to ride across
the Great Desert to Jerusalem, and it might perhaps be quite as
well to do that with him, as to go up the Nile as far as the
second cataract with the Damers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so, M. Delabordeau, you intend really to start for
Mount Sinai?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mees; ve intend to make one start on Monday
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so on to Jerusalem.&nbsp; You are quite
right.&nbsp; It would be a thousand pities to be in these
countries, and to return without going over such ground as
that.&nbsp; I shall certainly go to Jerusalem myself by that
route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vot, mees! you?&nbsp; Would you not find it too much
fatigante?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care nothing for fatigue, if I like the party I am
with,&mdash;nothing at all, literally.&nbsp; You will hardly
understand me, perhaps, M. Delabordeau; but I do not see any
reason why I, as a young woman, should not make any journey that
is practicable for a young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! dat is great resolution for you, mees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean as far as fatigue is concerned.&nbsp; You are a
Frenchman, and belong to the nation that is at the head of all
human civilisation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Delabordeau took off his hat and bowed low, to the peak of
his donkey saddle.&nbsp; He dearly loved to hear his country
praised, as Miss Dawkins was aware.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am sure you must agree with me,&rdquo; continued
Miss Dawkins, &ldquo;that the time is gone by for women to
consider themselves helpless animals, or to be so considered by
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mees Dawkins vould never be considered, not in any
times at all, to be one helpless animal,&rdquo; said M.
Delabordeau civilly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not, at any rate, intend to be so regarded,&rdquo;
said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;It suits me to travel alone; not that I am
averse to society; quite the contrary; if I meet pleasant people
I am always ready to join them.&nbsp; But it suits me to travel
without any permanent party, and I do not see why false shame
should prevent my seeing the world as thoroughly as though I
belonged to the other sex.&nbsp; Why should it, M.
Delabordeau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Delabordeau declared that he did not see any reason why it
should.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am passionately anxious to stand upon Mount
Sinai,&rdquo; continued Miss Dawkins; &ldquo;to press with my
feet the earliest spot in sacred history, of the identity of
which we are certain; to feel within me the awe-inspiring thrill
of that thrice sacred hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Frenchman looked as though he did not quite understand
her, but he said that it would be magnifique.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have already made up your party I suppose, M.
Delabordeau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Delabordeau gave the names of two Frenchmen and one
Englishman who were going with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word it is a great temptation to join
you,&rdquo; said Miss Dawkins, &ldquo;only for that horrid
Englishman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vat, Mr. Stanley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean any disrespect to Mr.
Stanley.&nbsp; The horridness I speak of does not attach to him
personally, but to his stiff, respectable, ungainly,
well-behaved, irrational, and uncivilised country.&nbsp; You see
I am not very patriotic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite so much as my friend, Mr. Damer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha! an excellent creature, isn&rsquo;t
he?&nbsp; And so they all are, dear creatures.&nbsp; But then
they are so backward.&nbsp; They are most anxious that I should
join them up the Nile, but&mdash;,&rdquo; and then Miss Dawkins
shrugged her shoulders gracefully, and, as she flattered herself,
like a Frenchwoman.&nbsp; After that they rode on in silence for
a few moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I must see Mount Sinai,&rdquo; said Miss Dawkins,
and then sighed deeply.&nbsp; M. Delabordeau, notwithstanding
that his country does stand at the head of all human
civilisation, was not courteous enough to declare that if Miss
Dawkins would join his party across the desert, nothing would be
wanting to make his beatitude in this world perfect.</p>
<p>Their road from the village of the chicken-hatching ovens lay
up along the left bank of the Nile, through an immense grove of
lofty palm-trees, looking out from among which our visitors could
ever and anon see the heads of the two great Pyramids;&mdash;that
is, such of them could see it as felt any solicitude in the
matter.</p>
<p>It is astonishing how such things lose their great charm as
men find themselves in their close neighbourhood.&nbsp; To one
living in New York or London, how ecstatic is the interest
inspired by these huge structures.&nbsp; One feels that no price
would be too high to pay for seeing them as long as time and
distance, and the world&rsquo;s inexorable task-work, forbid such
a visit.&nbsp; How intense would be the delight of climbing over
the wondrous handiwork of those wondrous architects so long since
dead; how thrilling the awe with which one would penetrate down
into their interior caves&mdash;those caves in which lay buried
the bones of ancient kings, whose very names seem to have come to
us almost from another world!</p>
<p>But all these feelings become strangely dim, their acute edges
wonderfully worn, as the subjects which inspired them are brought
near to us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! so those are the Pyramids, are
they?&rdquo; says the traveller, when the first glimpse of them
is shown to him from the window of a railway carriage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dear me; they don&rsquo;t look so very high, do
they?&nbsp; For Heaven&rsquo;s sake put the blind down, or we
shall be destroyed by the dust.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then the ecstasy
and keen delight of the Pyramids has vanished for ever.</p>
<p>Our friends, therefore, who for weeks past had seen from a
distance, though they had not yet visited them, did not seem to
have any strong feeling on the subject as they trotted through
the grove of palm-trees.&nbsp; Mr. Damer had not yet escaped from
his wife, who was still fretful from the result of her little
accident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all the chattering of that Miss Dawkins,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Damer.&nbsp; &ldquo;She would not let me attend to what
I was doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dawkins is an ass,&rdquo; said her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pity she has no one to look after her,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Damer.&nbsp; M. Delabordeau was still listening to Miss
Dawkins&rsquo;s raptures about Mount Sinai.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder
whether she has got any money,&rdquo; said M. Delabordeau to
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be much,&rdquo; he went on
thinking, &ldquo;or she would not be left in this way by
herself.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the result of his thoughts was that
Miss Dawkins, if undertaken, might probably become more plague
than profit.&nbsp; As to Miss Dawkins herself, though she was
ecstatic about Mount Sinai&mdash;which was not present&mdash;she
seemed to have forgotten the poor Pyramids, which were then
before her nose.</p>
<p>The two lads were riding races along the dusty path, much to
the disgust of their donkey-boys.&nbsp; Their time for enjoyment
was to come.&nbsp; There were hampers to be opened; and then the
absolute climbing of the Pyramids would actually be a delight to
them.</p>
<p>As for Miss Damer and Mr. Ingram, it was clear that they had
forgotten palm-trees, Pyramids, the Nile, and all Egypt.&nbsp;
They had escaped to a much fairer paradise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I bear to live among Republicans?&rdquo; said
Fanny, repeating the last words of her American lover, and
looking down from her donkey to the ground as she did so.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I hardly know what Republicans are, Mr. Ingram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me teach you,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do talk such nonsense.&nbsp; I declare there is
that Miss Dawkins looking at us as though she had twenty
eyes.&nbsp; Could you not teach her, Mr. Ingram?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they emerged from the palm-tree grove, through a
village crowded with dirty, straggling Arab children, on to the
cultivated plain, beyond which the Pyramids stood, now full
before them; the two large Pyramids, a smaller one, and the huge
sphynx&rsquo;s head all in a group together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; said Bob Damer, riding up to her,
&ldquo;mamma wants you; so toddle back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma wants me!&nbsp; What can she want me for
now?&rdquo; said Fanny, with a look of anything but filial duty
in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To protect her from Miss Dawkins, I think.&nbsp; She
wants you to ride at her side, so that Dawkins mayn&rsquo;t get
at her.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Ingram, I&rsquo;ll bet you half-a-crown
I&rsquo;m at the top of the big Pyramid before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Fanny!&nbsp; She obeyed, however; doubtless feeling that
it would not do as yet to show too plainly that she preferred Mr.
Ingram to her mother.&nbsp; She arrested her donkey, therefore,
till Mrs. Damer overtook her; and Mr. Ingram, as he paused for a
moment with her while she did so, fell into the hands of Miss
Dawkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot think, Fanny, how you get on so quick,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Damer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always last; but then my
donkey is such a very nasty one.&nbsp; Look there, now;
he&rsquo;s always trying to get me off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall soon be at the Pyramids now, mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How on earth I am ever to get back again I cannot
think.&nbsp; I am so tired now that I can hardly sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be better, mamma, when you get your
luncheon and a glass of wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How on earth we are to eat and drink with those nasty
Arab people around us, I can&rsquo;t conceive.&nbsp; They tell me
we shall be eaten up by them.&nbsp; But, Fanny, what has Mr.
Ingram been saying to you all the day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has he been saying, mamma?&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know;&mdash;a hundred things, I dare say.&nbsp; But
he has not been talking to me all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he has, Fanny, nearly, since we crossed the
river.&nbsp; Oh, dear! oh, dear! this animal does hurt me
so!&nbsp; Every time he moves he flings his head about, and that
gives me such a bump.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then Fanny commiserated
her mother&rsquo;s sufferings, and in her commiseration contrived
to elude any further questionings as to Mr. Ingram&rsquo;s
conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Majestic piles, are they not?&rdquo; said Miss Dawkins,
who, having changed her companion, allowed her mind to revert
from Mount Sinai to the Pyramids.&nbsp; They were now riding
through cultivated ground, with the vast extent of the sands of
Libya before them.&nbsp; The two Pyramids were standing on the
margin of the sand, with the head of the recumbent sphynx plainly
visible between them.&nbsp; But no idea can be formed of the size
of this immense figure till it is visited much more
closely.&nbsp; The body is covered with sand, and the head and
neck alone stand above the surface of the ground.&nbsp; They were
still two miles distant, and the sphynx as yet was but an obscure
mount between the two vast Pyramids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immense piles!&rdquo; said Miss Dawkins, repeating her
own words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are large,&rdquo; said Mr. Ingram, who did
not choose to indulge in enthusiasm in the presence of Miss
Dawkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enormous!&nbsp; What a grand idea!&mdash;eh, Mr.
Ingram?&nbsp; The human race does not create such things as those
nowadays!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but perhaps we
create better things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better!&nbsp; You do not mean to say, Mr. Ingram, that
you are an utilitarian.&nbsp; I do, in truth, hope better things
of you than that.&nbsp; Yes! steam mills are better, no doubt,
and mechanics&rsquo; institutes and penny newspapers.&nbsp; But
is nothing to be valued but what is useful?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Miss
Dawkins, in the height of her enthusiasm, switched her donkey
severely over the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might, perhaps, have said also that we create more
beautiful things,&rdquo; said Mr. Ingram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we cannot create older things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, certainly; we cannot do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor can we imbue what we do create with the grand
associations which environ those piles with so intense an
interest.&nbsp; Think of the mighty dead, Mr. Ingram, and of
their great homes when living.&nbsp; Think of the hands which it
took to raise those huge blocks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of the lives which it cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless.&nbsp; The tyranny and invincible power of
the royal architects add to the grandeur of the idea.&nbsp; One
would not wish to have back the kings of Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no; they would be neither useful nor
beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not; and I do not wish to be picturesque at the
expense of my fellow-creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt, even, whether they would be
picturesque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean, Mr. Ingram.&nbsp; But the
associations of such names, and the presence of the stupendous
works with which they are connected, fill the soul with
awe.&nbsp; Such, at least, is the effect with mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear that my tendencies, Miss Dawkins, are more
realistic than your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You belong to a young country, Mr. Ingram, and are
naturally prone to think of material life.&nbsp; The necessity of
living looms large before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very large, indeed, Miss Dawkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas with us, with some of us at least, the material
aspect has given place to one in which poetry and enthusiasm
prevail.&nbsp; To such among us the associations of past times
are very dear.&nbsp; Cheops, to me, is more than Napoleon
Bonaparte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is more than most of your countrymen can say, at
any rate, just at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a woman,&rdquo; continued Miss Dawkins.</p>
<p>Mr. Ingram took off his hat in acknowledgment both of the
announcement and of the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to us it is not given&mdash;not given as
yet&mdash;to share in the great deeds of the present.&nbsp; The
envy of your sex has driven us from the paths which lead to
honour.&nbsp; But the deeds of the past are as much ours as
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, quite as much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis to your country that we look for
enfranchisement from this thraldom.&nbsp; Yes, Mr. Ingram, the
women of America have that strength of mind which has been
wanting to those of Europe.&nbsp; In the United States woman will
at last learn to exercise her proper mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ingram expressed a sincere wish that such might be the
case; and then wondering at the ingenuity with which Miss Dawkins
had travelled round from Cheops and his Pyramid to the rights of
women in America, he contrived to fall back, under the pretence
of asking after the ailments of Mrs. Damer.</p>
<p>And now at last they were on the sand, in the absolute desert,
making their way up to the very foot of the most northern of the
two Pyramids.&nbsp; They were by this time surrounded by a crowd
of Arab guides, or Arabs professing to be guides, who had already
ascertained that Mr. Damer was the chief of the party, and were
accordingly driving him almost to madness by the offers of their
services, and their assurance that he could not possibly see the
outside or the inside of either structure, or even remain alive
upon the ground, unless he at once accepted their offers made at
their own prices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get away, will you?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want any of you, and I won&rsquo;t have you!&nbsp; If
you take hold of me I&rsquo;ll shoot you!&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
said to one specially energetic Arab, who, in his efforts to
secure his prey, had caught hold of Mr. Damer by the leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I say!&nbsp; Englishmen always take
me;&mdash;me&mdash;me, and then no break him leg.&nbsp;
Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes;&mdash;I go.&nbsp; Master, say yes.&nbsp;
Only one leetle ten shillings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abdallah!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Damer, &ldquo;why
don&rsquo;t you take this man away?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you
make him understand that if all the Pyramids depended on it, I
would not give him sixpence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Abdallah, thus invoked, came up, and explained to the
man in Arabic that he would gain his object more surely if he
would behave himself a little more quietly; a hint which the man
took for one minute, and for one minute only.</p>
<p>And then poor Mrs. Damer replied to an application for
backsheish by the gift of a sixpence.&nbsp; Unfortunate
woman!&nbsp; The word backsheish means, I believe, a gift; but it
has come in Egypt to signify money, and is eternally dinned into
the ears of strangers by Arab suppliants.&nbsp; Mrs. Damer ought
to have known better, as, during the last six weeks she had never
shown her face out of Shepheard&rsquo;s Hotel without being
pestered for backsheish; but she was tired and weak, and
foolishly thought to rid herself of the man who was annoying
her.</p>
<p>No sooner had the coin dropped from her hand into that of the
Arab, than she was surrounded by a cluster of beggars, who loudly
made their petitions as though they would, each of them,
individually be injured if treated with less liberality than that
first comer.&nbsp; They took hold of her donkey, her bridle, her
saddle, her legs, and at last her arms and hands, screaming for
backsheish in voices that were neither sweet nor mild.</p>
<p>In her dismay she did give away sundry small coins&mdash;all,
probably, that she had about her; but this only made the matter
worse.&nbsp; Money was going, and each man, by sufficient energy,
might hope to get some of it.&nbsp; They were very energetic, and
so frightened the poor lady that she would certainly have fallen,
had she not been kept on her seat by the pressure around her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! oh, dear! get away,&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any more; indeed I
haven&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Go away, I tell you!&nbsp; Mr. Damer! oh,
Mr. Damer!&rdquo; and then, in the excess of her agony, she
uttered one loud, long, and continuous shriek.</p>
<p>Up came Mr. Damer; up came Abdallah; up came M. Delabordeau;
up came Mr. Ingram, and at last she was rescued.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
shouldn&rsquo;t go away and leave me to the mercy of these nasty
people.&nbsp; As to that Abdallah, he is of no use to
anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why you bodder de good lady, you dem blackguard?&rdquo;
said Abdallah, raising his stick, as though he were going to lay
them all low with a blow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now you get noting, you
tief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Arabs for a moment retired to a little distance, like
flies driven from a sugar-bowl; but it was easy to see that, like
the flies, they would return at the first vacant moment.</p>
<p>And now they had reached the very foot of the Pyramids and
proceeded to dismount from their donkeys.&nbsp; Their intention
was first to ascend to the top, then to come down to their
banquet, and after that to penetrate into the interior.&nbsp; And
all this would seem to be easy of performance.&nbsp; The Pyramid
is undoubtedly high, but it is so constructed as to admit of
climbing without difficulty.&nbsp; A lady mounting it would
undoubtedly need some assistance, but any man possessed of
moderate activity would require no aid at all.</p>
<p>But our friends were at once imbued with the tremendous nature
of the task before them.&nbsp; A sheikh of the Arabs came forth,
who communicated with them through Abdallah.&nbsp; The work could
be done, no doubt, he said; but a great many men would be wanted
to assist.&nbsp; Each lady must have four Arabs, and each
gentlemen three; and then, seeing that the work would be
peculiarly severe on this special day, each of these numerous
Arabs must be remunerated by some very large number of
piastres.</p>
<p>Mr. Damer, who was by no means a close man in his money
dealings, opened his eyes with surprise, and mildly expostulated;
M. Delabordeau, who was rather a close man in his reckonings,
immediately buttoned up his breeches pocket and declared that he
should decline to mount the Pyramid at all at that price; and
then Mr. Ingram descended to the combat.</p>
<p>The protestations of the men were fearful.&nbsp; They
declared, with loud voices, eager actions, and manifold English
oaths, that an attempt was being made to rob them.&nbsp; They had
a right to demand the sums which they were charging, and it was a
shame that English gentlemen should come and take the bread out
of their mouths.&nbsp; And so they screeched, gesticulated, and
swore, and frightened poor Mrs. Damer almost into fits.</p>
<p>But at last it was settled and away they started, the sheikh
declaring that the bargain had been made at so low a rate as to
leave him not one piastre for himself.&nbsp; Each man had an Arab
on each side of him, and Miss Dawkins and Miss Damer had each, in
addition, one behind.&nbsp; Mrs. Damer was so frightened as
altogether to have lost all ambition to ascend.&nbsp; She sat
below on a fragment of stone, with the three dragomans standing
around her as guards; but even with the three dragomans the
attacks on her were so frequent, and as she declared afterwards
she was so bewildered, that she never had time to remember that
she had come there from England to see the Pyramids, and that she
was now immediately under them.</p>
<p>The boys, utterly ignoring their guides, scrambled up quicker
than the Arabs could follow them.&nbsp; Mr. Damer started off at
a pace which soon brought him to the end of his tether, and from
that point was dragged up by the sheer strength of his
assistants; thereby accomplishing the wishes of the men, who
induce their victims to start as rapidly as possible, in order
that they may soon find themselves helpless from want of
wind.&nbsp; Mr. Ingram endeavoured to attach himself to Fanny,
and she would have been nothing loth to have him at her right
hand instead of the hideous brown, shrieking, one-eyed Arab who
took hold of her.&nbsp; But it was soon found that any such
arrangement was impossible.&nbsp; Each guide felt that if he lost
his own peculiar hold he would lose his prey, and held on,
therefore, with invincible tenacity.&nbsp; Miss Dawkins looked,
too, as though she had thought to be attended to by some
Christian cavalier, but no Christian cavalier was
forthcoming.&nbsp; M. Delabordeau was the wisest, for he took the
matter quietly, did as he was bid, and allowed the guides nearly
to carry him to the top of the edifice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! so this is the top of the Pyramid, is it?&rdquo;
said Mr. Damer, bringing out his words one by one, being terribly
out of breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very wonderful, very wonderful,
indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful,&rdquo; said Miss Dawkins, whose breath
had not failed her in the least, &ldquo;very wonderful,
indeed!&nbsp; Only think, Mr. Damer, you might travel on for days
and days, till days became months, through those interminable
sands, and yet you would never come to the end of them.&nbsp; Is
it not quite stupendous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, quite,&mdash;puff, puff&rdquo;&mdash;said Mr.
Damer striving to regain his breath.</p>
<p>Mr. Damer was now at her disposal; weak and worn with toil and
travel, out of breath, and with half his manhood gone; if ever
she might prevail over him so as to procure from his mouth an
assent to that Nile proposition, it would be now.&nbsp; And after
all, that Nile proposition was the best one now before her.&nbsp;
She did not quite like the idea of starting off across the Great
Desert without any lady, and was not sure that she was prepared
to be fallen in love with by M. Delabordeau, even if there should
ultimately be any readiness on the part of that gentleman to
perform the r&ocirc;le of lover.&nbsp; With Mr. Ingram the matter
was different, nor was she so diffident of her own charms as to
think it altogether impossible that she might succeed, in the
teeth of that little chit, Fanny Damer.&nbsp; That Mr. Ingram
would join the party up the Nile she had very little doubt; and
then there would be one place left for her.&nbsp; She would thus,
at any rate, become commingled with a most respectable family,
who might be of material service to her.</p>
<p>Thus actuated she commenced an earnest attack upon Mr.
Damer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupendous!&rdquo; she said again, for she was fond of
repeating favourite words.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a wondrous race must
have been those Egyptian kings of old!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say they were,&rdquo; said Mr. Damer, wiping his
brow as he sat upon a large loose stone, a fragment lying on the
flat top of the Pyramid, one of those stones with which the
complete apex was once made, or was once about to be made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A magnificent race! so gigantic in their
conceptions!&nbsp; Their ideas altogether overwhelm us poor,
insignificant, latter-day mortals.&nbsp; They built these vast
Pyramids; but for us, it is task enough to climb to their
top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite enough,&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Damer.</p>
<p>But Mr. Damer would not always remain weak and out of breath,
and it was absolutely necessary for Miss Dawkins to hurry away
from Cheops and his tomb, to Thebes and Karnac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After seeing this it is impossible for any one with a
spark of imagination to leave Egypt without going farther
a-field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Damer merely wiped his brow and grunted.&nbsp; This Miss
Dawkins took as a signal of weakness, and went on with her task
perseveringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For myself, I have resolved to go up, at any rate, as
far as Asouan and the first cataract.&nbsp; I had thought of
acceding to the wishes of a party who are going across the Great
Desert by Mount Sinai to Jerusalem; but the kindness of yourself
and Mrs. Damer is so great, and the prospect of joining in your
boat is so pleasurable, that I have made up my mind to accept
your very kind offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, it will be acknowledged, was bold on the part of Miss
Dawkins; but what will not audacity effect?&nbsp; To use the
slang of modern language, cheek carries everything
nowadays.&nbsp; And whatever may have been Miss Dawkins&rsquo;s
deficiencies, in this virtue she was not deficient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have made up my mind to accept your very kind
offer,&rdquo; she said, shining on Mr. Damer with her blandest
smile.</p>
<p>What was a stout, breathless, perspiring, middle-aged
gentleman to do under such circumstances?&nbsp; Mr. Damer was a
man who, in most matters, had his own way.&nbsp; That his wife
should have given such an invitation without consulting him, was,
he knew, quite impossible.&nbsp; She would as soon have thought
of asking all those Arab guides to accompany them.&nbsp; Nor was
it to be thought of that he should allow himself to be kidnapped
into such an arrangement by the impudence of any Miss
Dawkins.&nbsp; But there was, he felt, a difficulty in answering
such a proposition from a young lady with a direct negative,
especially while he was so scant of breath.&nbsp; So he wiped his
brow again, and looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can only agree to this on one
understanding,&rdquo; continued Miss Dawkins, &ldquo;and that is,
that I am allowed to defray my own full share of the expense of
the journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon hearing this Mr. Damer thought that he saw his way out of
the wood.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherever I go, Miss Dawkins, I am always
the paymaster myself,&rdquo; and this he contrived to say with
some sternness, palpitating though he still was; and the
sternness which was deficient in his voice he endeavoured to put
into his countenance.</p>
<p>But he did not know Miss Dawkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Mr.
Damer,&rdquo; she said, and as she spoke her smile became almost
blander than it was before; &ldquo;oh, Mr. Damer, I could not
think of suffering you to be so liberal; I could not,
indeed.&nbsp; But I shall be quite content that you should pay
everything, and let me settle with you in one sum
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Damer&rsquo;s breath was now rather more under his own
command.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid, Miss Dawkins,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that Mrs. Damer&rsquo;s weak state of health will not
admit of such an arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, about the paying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only as to that, but we are a family party, Miss
Dawkins; and great as would be the benefit of your society to all
of us, in Mrs. Damer&rsquo;s present state of health, I am
afraid&mdash;in short, you would not find it agreeable.&mdash;And
therefore&mdash;&rdquo; this he added, seeing that she was still
about to persevere&mdash;&ldquo;I fear that we must forego the
advantage you offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, looking into his face, Miss Dawkins did perceive
that even her audacity would not prevail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; she said, and moving from the
stone on which she had been sitting, she walked off, carrying her
head very high, to a corner of the Pyramid from which she could
look forth alone towards the sands of Libya.</p>
<p>In the mean time another little overture was being made on the
top of the same Pyramid,&mdash;an overture which was not received
quite in the same spirit.&nbsp; While Mr. Damer was recovering
his breath for the sake of answering Miss Dawkins, Miss Damer had
walked to the further corner of the square platform on which they
were placed, and there sat herself down with her face turned
towards Cairo.&nbsp; Perhaps it was not singular that Mr. Ingram
should have followed her.</p>
<p>This would have been very well if a dozen Arabs had not also
followed them.&nbsp; But as this was the case, Mr. Ingram had to
play his game under some difficulty.&nbsp; He had no sooner
seated himself beside her than they came and stood directly in
front of the seat, shutting out the view, and by no means
improving the fragrance of the air around them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this, then, Miss Damer, will be our last excursion
together,&rdquo; he said, in his tenderest, softest tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;De good Englishman will gib de poor Arab one little
backsheish,&rdquo; said an Arab, putting out his hand and shaking
Mr. Ingram&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes; him gib backsheish,&rdquo; said
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him berry good man,&rdquo; said a third, putting up his
filthy hand, and touching Mr. Ingram&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And young lady berry good, too; she give backsheish to
poor Arab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said a fourth, preparing to take a similar
liberty with Miss Damer.</p>
<p>This was too much for Mr. Ingram.&nbsp; He had already used
very positive language in his endeavour to assure his tormentors
that they would not get a piastre from him.&nbsp; But this only
changed their soft persuasions into threats.&nbsp; Upon hearing
which, and upon seeing what the man attempted to do in his
endeavour to get money from Miss Damer, he raised his stick, and
struck first one and then the other as violently as he could upon
their heads.</p>
<p>Any ordinary civilised men would have been stunned by such
blows, for they fell on the bare foreheads of the Arabs; but the
objects of the American&rsquo;s wrath merely skulked away; and
the others, convinced by the only arguments which they
understood, followed in pursuit of victims who might be less
pugnacious.</p>
<p>It is hard for a man to be at once tender and
pugnacious&mdash;to be sentimental, while he is putting forth his
physical strength with all the violence in his power.&nbsp; It is
difficult, also, for him to be gentle instantly after having been
in a rage.&nbsp; So he changed his tactics at the moment, and
came to the point at once in a manner befitting his present state
of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those vile wretches have put me in such a heat,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;that I hardly know what I am saying.&nbsp; But
the fact is this, Miss Damer, I cannot leave Cairo without
knowing&mdash;.&nbsp; You understand what I mean, Miss
Damer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do not, Mr. Ingram; except that I am afraid
you mean nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you do; you know that I love you.&nbsp; I am sure
you must know it.&nbsp; At any rate you know it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ingram, you should not talk in such a
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I not?&nbsp; But the truth is, Fanny, I can
talk in no other way.&nbsp; I do love you dearly.&nbsp; Can you
love me well enough to go and be my wife in a country far away
from your own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she left the top of the Pyramid Fanny Damer had said
that she would try.</p>
<p>Mr. Ingram was now a proud and happy man, and seemed to think
the steps of the Pyramid too small for his elastic energy.&nbsp;
But Fanny feared that her troubles were to come.&nbsp; There was
papa&mdash;that terrible bugbear on all such occasions.&nbsp;
What would papa say?&nbsp; She was sure her papa would not allow
her to marry and go so far away from her own family and
country.&nbsp; For herself, she liked the Americans&mdash;always
had liked them; so she said;&mdash;would desire nothing better
than to live among them.&nbsp; But papa!&nbsp; And Fanny sighed
as she felt that all the recognised miseries of a young lady in
love were about to fall upon her.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, at her lover&rsquo;s instance, she promised, and
declared, in twenty different loving phrases, that nothing on
earth should ever make her false to her love or to her lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fanny, where are you?&nbsp; Why are you not ready to
come down?&rdquo; shouted Mr. Damer, not in the best of
tempers.&nbsp; He felt that he had almost been unkind to an
unprotected female, and his heart misgave him.&nbsp; And yet it
would have misgiven him more had he allowed himself to be
entrapped by Miss Dawkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite ready, papa,&rdquo; said Fanny, running up
to him&mdash;for it may be understood that there is quite room
enough for a young lady to run on the top of the Pyramid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know where you have been all
the time,&rdquo; said Mr. Damer; &ldquo;and where are those two
boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fanny pointed to the top of the other Pyramid, and there they
were, conspicuous with their red caps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And M. Delabordeau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he has gone down, I think;&mdash;no, he is there
with Miss Dawkins.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in truth Miss Dawkins was
leaning on his arm most affectionately, as she stooped over and
looked down upon the ruins below her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is that fellow, Ingram?&rdquo; said Mr.
Damer, looking about him.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is always out of the
way when he&rsquo;s wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Fanny said nothing.&nbsp; Why should she?&nbsp; She
was not Mr. Ingram&rsquo;s keeper.</p>
<p>And then they all descended, each again with his proper number
of Arabs to hurry and embarrass him; and they found Mr. Damer at
the bottom, like a piece of sugar covered with flies.&nbsp; She
was heard to declare afterwards that she would not go to the
Pyramids again, not if they were to be given to her for herself,
as ornaments for her garden.</p>
<p>The picnic lunch among the big stones at the foot of the
Pyramid was not a very gay affair.&nbsp; Miss Dawkins talked more
than any one else, being determined to show that she bore her
defeat gallantly.&nbsp; Her conversation, however, was chiefly
addressed to M. Delabordeau, and he seemed to think more of his
cold chicken and ham than he did of her wit and attention.</p>
<p>Fanny hardly spoke a word.&nbsp; There was her father before
her and she could not eat, much less talk, as she thought of all
that she would have to go through.&nbsp; What would he say to the
idea of having an American for a son-in-law?</p>
<p>Nor was Mr. Ingram very lively.&nbsp; A young man when he has
been just accepted, never is so.&nbsp; His happiness under the
present circumstances was, no doubt, intense, but it was of a
silent nature.</p>
<p>And then the interior of the building had to be visited.&nbsp;
To tell the truth none of the party would have cared to perform
this feat had it not been for the honour of the thing.&nbsp; To
have come from Paris, New York, or London, to the Pyramids, and
then not to have visited the very tomb of Cheops, would have
shown on the part of all of them an indifference to subjects of
interest which would have been altogether fatal to their
character as travellers.&nbsp; And so a party for the interior
was made up.</p>
<p>Miss Damer when she saw the aperture through which it was
expected that she should descend, at once declared for staying
with her mother.&nbsp; Miss Dawkins, however, was enthusiastic
for the journey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Persons with so very little command
over their nerves might really as well stay at home,&rdquo; she
said to Mr. Ingram, who glowered at her dreadfully for expressing
such an opinion about his Fanny.</p>
<p>This entrance into the Pyramids is a terrible task, which
should be undertaken by no lady.&nbsp; Those who perform it have
to creep down, and then to be dragged up, through infinite dirt,
foul smells, and bad air; and when they have done it, they see
nothing.&nbsp; But they do earn the gratification of saying that
they have been inside a Pyramid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve done that once,&rdquo; said Mr. Damer,
coming out, &ldquo;and I do not think that any one will catch me
doing it again.&nbsp; I never was in such a filthy place in my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Fanny! I am so glad you did not go; I am sure it is
not fit for ladies,&rdquo; said poor Mrs. Damer, forgetful of her
friend Miss Dawkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have been ashamed of myself,&rdquo; said Miss
Dawkins, bristling up, and throwing back her head as she stood,
&ldquo;if I had allowed any consideration to have prevented my
visiting such a spot.&nbsp; If it be not improper for men to go
there, how can it be improper for women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not say improper, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Damer, apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for the fatigue, what can a woman be worth who
is afraid to encounter as much as I have now gone through for the
sake of visiting the last resting-place of such a king as
Cheops?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Miss Dawkins, as she pronounced the last
words, looked round her with disdain upon poor Fanny Damer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I meant the dirt,&rdquo; said Mrs. Damer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dirt!&rdquo; ejaculated Miss Dawkins, and then walked
away.&nbsp; Why should she now submit her high tone of feeling to
the Damers, or why care longer for their good opinion?&nbsp;
Therefore she scattered contempt around her as she ejaculated the
last word, &ldquo;dirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the return home!&nbsp; &ldquo;I know I shall never
get there,&rdquo; said Mrs. Damer, looking piteously up into her
husband&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, my dear; nonsense; you must get
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Damer groaned, and acknowledged in her
heart that she must,&mdash;either dead or alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Jefferson,&rdquo; said Fanny, whispering&mdash;for
there had been a moment since their descent in which she had been
instructed to call him by his Christian name&mdash;&ldquo;never
mind talking to me going home.&nbsp; I will ride by mamma.&nbsp;
Do you go with papa and put him in good humour; and it he says
anything about the lords and the bishops, don&rsquo;t you
contradict him, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What will not a man do for love?&nbsp; Mr. Ingram
promised.</p>
<p>And in this way they started; the two boys led the van; then
came Mr. Damer and Mr. Ingram, unusually and unpatriotically
acquiescent as to England&rsquo;s aristocratic propensities; then
Miss Dawkins riding, alas! alone; after her, M. Delabordeau, also
alone,&mdash;the ungallant Frenchman!&nbsp; And the rear was
brought up by Mrs. Damer and her daughter, flanked on each side
by a dragoman, with a third dragoman behind them.</p>
<p>And in this order they went back to Cairo, riding their
donkeys, and crossing the ferry solemnly, and, for the most part,
silently.&nbsp; Mr. Ingram did talk, as he had an important
object in view,&mdash;that of putting Mr. Damer into a good
humour.</p>
<p>In this he succeeded so well that by the time they had
remounted, after crossing the Nile, Mr. Damer opened his heart to
his companion on the subject that was troubling him, and told him
all about Miss Dawkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we should have a companion that
we don&rsquo;t like for eight or ten weeks, merely because it
seems rude to refuse a lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I agree with you,&rdquo; said Mr. Ingram;
&ldquo;I should call it weak-minded to give way in such a
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter does not like her at all,&rdquo; continued
Mr. Damer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor would she be a nice companion for Miss Damer; not
according to my way of thinking,&rdquo; said Mr. Ingram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as to my having asked her, or Mrs. Damer having
asked her!&nbsp; Why, God bless my soul, it is pure invention on
the woman&rsquo;s part!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed Mr. Ingram; &ldquo;I must
say she plays her game well; but then she is an old soldier, and
has the benefit of experience.&rdquo;&nbsp; What would Miss
Dawkins have said had she known that Mr. Ingram called her an old
soldier?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the kind of thing at all,&rdquo;
said Mr. Damer, who was very serious upon the subject.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You see the position in which I am placed.&nbsp; I am
forced to be very rude, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call it rude at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disobliging, then; or else I must have all my comfort
invaded and pleasure destroyed by, by, by&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And
Mr. Damer paused, being at a loss for an appropriate name for
Miss Dawkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By an unprotected female,&rdquo; suggested Mr.
Ingram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just so.&nbsp; I am as fond of pleasant company as
anybody; but then I like to choose it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Mr. Ingram, thinking of his own
choice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Ingram, if you would join us, we should be
delighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, sir, the offer is too flattering,&rdquo;
said Ingram, hesitatingly; for he felt that he could not
undertake such a journey until Mr. Damer knew on what terms he
stood with Fanny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a terrible democrat,&rdquo; said Mr. Damer,
laughing; &ldquo;but then, on that matter, you know, we could
agree to differ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; said Mr. Ingram, who had not
collected his thoughts or made up his mind as to what he had
better say and do, on the spur of the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you say to it?&rdquo; said Mr. Damer,
encouragingly.&nbsp; But Ingram paused before he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, my dear fellow, don&rsquo;t
have the slightest hesitation in refusing, if you don&rsquo;t
like the plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is, Mr. Damer, I should like it too
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it too well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, and I may as well tell you now as
later.&nbsp; I had intended this evening to have asked for your
permission to address your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; said Mr. Damer, looking as
though a totally new idea had now been opened to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And under these circumstances, I will now wait and see
whether or no you will renew your offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; said Mr. Damer, again.&nbsp;
It often does strike an old gentleman as very odd that any man
should fall in love with his daughter, whom he has not ceased to
look upon as a child.&nbsp; The case is generally quite different
with mothers.&nbsp; They seem to think that every young man must
fall in love with their girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you said anything to Fanny about this?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Damer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I have her permission to speak to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; said Mr. Damer; and by this
time they had arrived at Shepheard&rsquo;s Hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mamma,&rdquo; said Fanny, as soon as she found
herself alone with her mother that evening, &ldquo;I have
something that I must tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Fanny, don&rsquo;t tell me anything to-night, for I
am a great deal too tired to listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But oh, mamma, pray;&mdash;you must listen to this;
indeed you must.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Fanny knelt down at her
mother&rsquo;s knee, and looked beseechingly up into her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Fanny?&nbsp; You know that all my bones are
sore, and I am so tired that I am almost dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma, Mr. Ingram has&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has what, my dear? has he done anything
wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mamma: but he has;&mdash;he has proposed to
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Fanny, bursting into tears, hid her face in
her mother&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>And thus the story was told on both sides of the house.&nbsp;
On the next day, as a matter of course, all the difficulties and
dangers of such a marriage as that which was now projected were
insisted on by both father and mother.&nbsp; It was improper; it
would cause a severing of the family not to be thought of; it
would be an alliance of a dangerous nature, and not at all
calculated to insure happiness; and, in short, it was
impossible.&nbsp; On that day, therefore, they all went to bed
very unhappy.&nbsp; But on the next day, as was also a matter of
course, seeing that there were no pecuniary difficulties, the
mother and father were talked over, and Mr. Ingram was accepted
as a son-in-law.&nbsp; It need hardly be said that the offer of a
place in Mr. Damer&rsquo;s boat was again made, and that on this
occasion it was accepted without hesitation.</p>
<p>There was an American Protestant clergyman resident in Cairo,
with whom, among other persons, Miss Dawkins had become
acquainted.&nbsp; Upon this gentleman or upon his wife Miss
Dawkins called a few days after the journey to the Pyramid, and
finding him in his study, thus performed her duty to her
neighbour,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know your countryman Mr. Ingram, I think?&rdquo;
said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; very intimately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have any regard for him, Mr. Burton,&rdquo; such
was the gentleman&rsquo;s name, &ldquo;I think you should put him
on his guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On his guard against what?&rdquo; said Mr. Burton with
a serious air, for there was something serious in the threat of
impending misfortune as conveyed by Miss Dawkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;those Damers, I fear, are
dangerous people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that they will borrow money of
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; not that, exactly; but they are clearly setting
their cap at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Setting their cap at him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; there is a daughter, you know; a little chit of a
thing; and I fear Mr. Ingram may be caught before he knows where
he is.&nbsp; It would be such a pity, you know.&nbsp; He is going
up the river with them, I hear.&nbsp; That, in his place, is very
foolish.&nbsp; They asked me, but I positively
refused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Burton remarked that &ldquo;In such a matter as that Mr.
Ingram would be perfectly able to take care of
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps so; but seeing what was going on, I
thought it my duty to tell you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so Miss Dawkins
took her leave.</p>
<p>Mr. Ingram did go up the Nile with the Damers, as did an old
friend of the Damers who arrived from England.&nbsp; And a very
pleasant trip they had of it.&nbsp; And, as far as the present
historian knows, the two lovers were shortly afterwards married
in England.</p>
<p>Poor Miss Dawkins was left in Cairo for some time on her beam
ends.&nbsp; But she was one of those who are not easily
vanquished.&nbsp; After an interval of ten days she made
acquaintance with an Irish family&mdash;having utterly failed in
moving the hard heart of M. Delabordeau&mdash;and with these she
proceeded to Constantinople.&nbsp; They consisted of two brothers
and a sister, and were, therefore, very convenient for
matrimonial purposes.&nbsp; But nevertheless, when I last heard
of Miss Dawkins, she was still an unprotected female.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
